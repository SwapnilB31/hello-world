# hello-world
This the Read Me file for the hello-world repository of my git-account. I'm only making this because I have an indispensible need to
follow tutorials and instructions. Since, this repository is supposed to be like my "About" section, I'll add a few details here.
I am a second year CS undergrad and I was thinking about starting to actively contribute in Github for a while, but obviously i didn't do
it thanks to my supernatural procrastination skills, but i am starting now. I am going to be focusing my contributions to mostly
pet-projects and applications I develop. I code in C, C++ and Java, and quite naturally I am going to write my porjects in those
languages. I am also learning python, so that might come up in three to four months.

That's about it. Thanks for visiting my profile.

This is just to test the pull request.
